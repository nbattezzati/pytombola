# pytombola
PyTombola is a Python script that generates the Tombola numbers in a random fashion.
<br>
See Tombola rules <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tombola_(game)>here</a>.

Every number is accompanied by the corresponding sentence in the <a href=https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Smorfia>Smorfia napoletana</a>.

PyTombola is thought for who plays this game during the Christmas days but don't want to extract and read the numbers. Indeed the script is able to read numbers and the sentences by means of the pyttsx3 text-to-speech.
